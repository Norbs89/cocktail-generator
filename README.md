# Cocktail recipe generator react app.

This project was built with React.js.

The core functionality was done by pair programming with a classmate.
Feel free to fork, clone and play around with the code to your heart's content!

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. Firstly, you will need to fork this repository, clone it to your machine and then open it up in your chosen code editor.

In your terminal:

```
git clone <link>

cd <name of folder>
```

## Prerequisites
In order to get started, you will need Node.js and NPM installed on your machine.

If you are unsure about whether you have these installed, type the following command into your terminal:

```
node -v
npm -v
```

If both of these commands show a version number, then you have them installed, if not then go into your terminal and type:

```
sudo apt install nodejs
sudo apt install npm
```

Once you have it on your machine, to run the code and see the changes you have done, use:

```
npm start
```

## Thank you for looking! Happy coding!
